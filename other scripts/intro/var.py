# Hi there! This file contains some variables that represent different kinds of data
# structures in Python. Part of the lesson will involve you creating your own to see 
# how they work, but we can also load these directly without having to type a bunch
# of stuff out.
#
# By the way--any line of text that begins with '#' is considered a comment; the Python
# interpreter won't touch it. It's a great place to make notes about what your code
# is doing.
